## Installing Python through Anaconda
[Python](https://python.org/) is a popular language for scientific computing, and great for general-purpose programming as well. Installing all of its scientific packages individually can be a bit difficult, however, so we recommend the all-in-one installer Anaconda.

Regardless of how you choose to install it, *please make sure you install Python version 3.x (e.g., 3.4 is fine, 2.7 is not)*.  Also, please set up your python environment at least a day in advance of the workshop. If you encounter problems with the installation procedure, the instructors will be available 30 minutes before the workshop begins to help you.

## Windows - [Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxQ0mzZ8UvA)

1. Open the [Anaconda Windows download page](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#windows).
2. Download the installer.  **Be sure you get the Python 3 version.**
3. Double-click the installer icon and follow the setup instructions on screen.  You can use MOST of the default options.  The only exception is to check the **Make Anaconda the default Python** option.

## Mac OS X - [Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcSAln46u9U)

1. Open the [Anaconda MacOS download page](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos).
2. Download the installer. **Be sure you get the Python 3 version.**
3. Double click the installer icon and follow the setup instructions.  You can use all of the default options.

## Obtain lesson materials
1. Put link to download materials here.
2. Create a folder called `cms-workshop` on your Desktop.
3. Move the downloaded materials to the new folder.
4. Unzip the file.  

## Open the Terminal Window
- Windows:  Click Windows Key + R, type cmd, press Enter.
- MacOS: The Terminal application can be found in Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal.

## Start a Jupyter notebook
In the Terminal window, type
```
$ jupyter notebook
```
It may take a few seconds to load the page, especially if it is the first time you have ever used the jupyter notebook, so don't panic if nothing loads for a few seconds.  Then a new window should open in your default internet browser. Use the file navigation window to navigate to the `cms-workshop` folder.  In the upper right hand corner, click New, then choose Python 3 from the dropdown list.  You're ready to go!
